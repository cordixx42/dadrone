Abstract:
The integration of computer vision with thermofluid flow analysis offers a promising approach to enhance the understanding and monitoring of complex thermal and fluid systems. Traditional methods of thermofluid analysis often rely on intrusive sensors or computationally expensive simulations, which can limit real-time analysis and the understanding of dynamic behaviors in intricate systems. By utilizing computer vision techniques, such as image processing, deep learning, and pattern recognition, we can extract key thermal and fluid flow characteristics from visual data captured by infrared cameras, high-speed cameras, and other sensing technologies. This approach enables the non-invasive measurement of temperature distribution, velocity fields, turbulence, and flow patterns in real-time, providing a cost-effective and efficient means of monitoring and controlling thermofluid processes. The ability to process large volumes of visual data allows for enhanced predictive capabilities, optimization of system performance, and improved decision-making in various industrial applications, including heat exchangers, cooling systems, and aerodynamics. This paper explores the potential of combining computer vision with thermofluid flow dynamics to offer more accurate, scalable, and adaptable solutions for industrial applications, opening new avenues for research and innovation in fluid mechanics and thermal systems engineering.
